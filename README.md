### This map was created as my final project in my Cartography class in Fall 2024, I've always had a strong interest in using GIS for wildlife analysis. In this project I pulled in a myraid of data from LANDFIRE, the NLCD, and the National Parks Service. The overall data processing workflow was building a tessellation across the park, and then construction various raster layers based on different variables of fire risk (promiximity to roads, vegetation class, vegetation bulk density, slope, to name a few). Then assigning a risk factor from 1-5 based on the variable, lastly performing a raster sum of all risk layers to get a final risk tally of each tessellation grid. Continued with adding on a lego style in ArcGIS Pro, and refining that symbology and labels in Adobe Illustrator.
