## Yellowstone Wildfire Risk Lego

### This map was created as my final project in my Cartography class in Fall 2024, I've always had a strong interest in using GIS for wildlife analysis. 

In this project I pulled in a myraid of data from LANDFIRE, the NLCD, and the National Parks Service. The workflow consisted of: 

- building a tessellation across the park
- construction various raster layers based on different variables of fire risk
    - promiximity to roads
    - vegetation class and bulk density
    - Slope and ascept
Assigning a risk factor from 1-5 based on the fire risk variables, and performing a raster sum on all the previous layers to get a finaly risk talley for each cell in the tessellation 

Continued by adding on a lego style in ArcGIS Pro, using ESRI's remixer and I then continued to refine the symbology in Adobe Illustrator:
- Polishing the lego typeface and adding the labels
- Legend design
- Creating the state boarders
